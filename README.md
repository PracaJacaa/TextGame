TextGame
This is a small, just-for-fun text adventure game built using Deno and the Fresh web framework. It's mostly a learning project to get familiar with Deno, Fresh, and how to build simple interactive web apps.

🧠 Why?
I wanted to try out:

Deno (as an alternative to Node.js)

Fresh (a web framework for Deno)

Building something small and interactive in the browser

No big goals — just experimenting and having fun.
